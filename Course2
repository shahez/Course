Divide and Conquer Algorithms
It's a fundamental approach that mirrors how we often approach complex tasks in everyday life. By breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces, we can often find more efficient and effective solutions. It does has it's downsided but it's the more preferred approach by programmers to find the initial solution and later optimize it by using the other algorithms.
